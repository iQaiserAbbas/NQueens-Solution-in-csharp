# N Queen Problem

The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## Installation

To run the code use visual studio 2017 or latest version.

## Usage

Backtracking Algorithm
The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a column, we check for clashes with already placed queens. In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution. If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.
